By deploying their fleet of systems, they aim to remove 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in just five years' time. By having the same mission on tackling waste problems, The Ocean Cleanup cooperates with Waste4Change as their local partner in Indonesia and conducted a riverine plastic emission study in Jakarta's rivers in April 2018.<br>During a 10-day fieldwork supported by DKI Jakarta Orange Troops, plastics were monitored at 7 river points throughout Jakarta, which includes Ciliwung and Pesanggrahan River. Plastic samples were trawled and analyzed by dividing them into different types. By having these data, hopefully appropriate measures can be done to tackle marine debris starting from the rivers, not only in Jakarta, but throughout Indonesia and in neighboring countries.",
